Now, these are only three of the most popular ways to structure your week, but there are plenty more. Do your research and experiment with what feels best for you. In time, you will know the best split for your body and your goals. Just keep your lifting consistent, and watch your gains blossom</p>

                    <p>One author conducted the literature search, collated the abstracts, and applied the initial inclusion criteria. The keyword “CrossFit” was used during the electronic search. The following electronic databases were searched on the 25th of November 2016: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Bireme/MedLine, and SciELO (Fig. 1). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines were adhered to in this manuscript.</p>

                    <p>Subjects were randomly assigned to either a TB or SR training group. Both groups performed a 10-week training program using the same exercises and the same total number of repetitions per set. During each training session, subjects in the TB group performed exercises recruiting muscle groups of both the upper and lower body, while subjects in the SR group performed a training program involving a limited number of muscle groups per training session. </p>

                    <p>Bulking is a term commonly thrown around by bodybuilders.It generally refers to a progressive increase in the number of calories consumed beyond your body’s needs in combination with intense weight training.Whereas some people claim that bulking is unhealthy, others insist that it’s a safe and effective method for gaining muscle mass..</p>

                    <p>To maintain muscle mass during the cutting phase, it's advised to keep protein on the higher range and spread protein intake throughout the day, including snacks with protein," she says. Like bulking, cutting should be gradual, with a goal of 0.5–2 pounds lost per week. Activity should be different as well, she adds. Cutting tends to be most effective with increases in cardiovascular exercise, rather than strength training</p>
